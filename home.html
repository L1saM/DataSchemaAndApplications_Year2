                        towns", and "friendship towns".
                        The European Commission uses the term "twinned towns" and refers to the process as "town
                        twinning".
                        Spain uses the term "ciudades hermanadas", which means "sister cities".</em></p>

                <p><em>Yes. A good twinning partnership can bring many benefits to a community and the municipality.
                        By bringing people together from different parts of Europe, it gives an opportunity to share
                        problems, exchange views and understand different viewpoints on any issue where there is a
                        shared

                        citizens who vowed that Europe should never again be torn apart by war.
                        Most of the twinnings were between towns from countries that had, till recently, been divided by
                        war. official relationship-builder, started in Europe after the second world war.
                        The idea was simple: repair damaged relationships between France, Germany and the UK.
                        Find towns that suffered during the wars and pair them. Then encourage people from these areas
                        to
                        meet, mix and get along.</em></p>
